  "body": "### Inspiration\r\nI came up with this idea when I was in 12th grade physics class and I kept getting pounded with a list of vocab I had to do. I was so tired of having to go into the book and find where it was and then writing it down. I would like to see kids in Highschool get to use this program to make their life a lot easier and cut their vocab homework time.\r\n\r\n### What It Does\r\nThe Backend of the program parses the data from dictionary.com and then uses a couple formatting functions to get it to the user how he/she wants it.\r\n\r\n### What I Made It With\r\nI made the Graphical User Interface(GUI) With Netbeans, and then coded the actual project inside of Eclipse and IntelliJ. \r\nI am the only contributor at this time, Andrew Corp @corpandrew\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
