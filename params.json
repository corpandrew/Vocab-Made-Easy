  "body": "### Inspiration\r\nI came up with this idea when I was in 12th grade physics class and I kept getting pounded with lists of vocab I had to do. I was so tired of having to go into the book and find where it was and then writing it down. I would like to see students in High School get to use this program to make their lives a lot easier and cut their vocab homework time.\r\n\r\n### What It Does\r\nThe Backend of the program parses the data from dictionary.com and then uses a couple formatting functions to get it to the user how he/she wants it.\r\n\r\n### What I Made It With\r\nI made the Graphical User Interface(GUI) With Netbeans, and then coded the actual project inside of Eclipse and IntelliJ. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI am the only contributor at this time, Andrew Corp @corpandrew\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the program? Send me an email at corpa@wit.edu for any help you may need.",
